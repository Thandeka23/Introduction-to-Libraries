Python Libraries for Data Analysis

Overview
This project demonstrates the usage of Python's standard libraries for performing essential operations such as mathematical calculations, file handling, working with dates, and generating random numbers. The project covers key libraries like math, os, datetime, and random for various common tasks.

Questions and Solutions
Question 1: Importance of Libraries in Python
Libraries in Python are pre-written code that help perform common tasks, making programming faster and more efficient. They allow us to reuse code for complex tasks and avoid reinventing the wheel.

Three commonly used libraries for data analysis:

Pandas - Used for data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy - Provides support for large multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with mathematical functions.
Matplotlib - A plotting library used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
Question 2: Math Library Usage
This task explores how to use the math library to perform mathematical operations like square root, power, and logarithms.

Question 3: OS Library Usage
This task involves using the os library to list all files and directories within a specified path on your system.

Question 4: Datetime Library Usage
The datetime library is used to display the current date, time, and the day of the week.

Question 5: Random Library Usage
This task focuses on generating random integers using the random library and saving the generated numbers to a file named random_numbers.txt.

Files
random_numbers.txt: Contains the randomly generated numbers.
